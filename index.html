			<p> David Militante is an eclectic content creator.  For the last 3 decades his creative works have included a large body of landscape and experimental photography, development in several software and website projects, blog and ebook publishing, and musical recordings. </p> 
			<ul>


				<li>	As a developer he has worked on Windows application software and building eCommerce solutions.  Additionally he has worked extensively in the role of consultant, repairing and correcting errors in systems for his clients and developing solutions to meet their needs.  For the last decade he has helped others position themselves more effectively in the realm of social media.</li>

				<li> Since 1998, when he acquired his first digital camera, he has mastered the art of digital photography.  Working with simple point and shoot cameras to professional equipment, his body of work spans 2 decades and has been featured on websites as content and background images, marketing materials for software applications, and sold as prints for art collectors. </li>
				<li> Blogging was a hobby that started an experiment.  His body of work has ranged from political post to tech manuals for software products and informative content for commerce solutions. </li>

For the next decade he spent most of his life perfecting his skills as a musician and learning how to work with recording equipment and effects.
