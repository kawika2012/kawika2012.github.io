			<ul>


				<li> Software Developer: I learned to program in several languages when Windows was emerging, DOS was the dominant platform, and the web consisted of mostly HTML and Javascript was just being developed.  My first Developer Job was in 1998 and I was tasked with porting 16 bit Windows software to 32 bit. I worked in the Windows / .Net platform extensively until 2003.  In 2004, I took on the role of Web developer for Shoreline of Tahoe, I worked for them as an Employee until 2007 and as a Consultant until 2014.  I have also worked on many small, personal websites and social media content formats for individual and small business clients.	</li>

				<li> IT: From 1994 I have been working as a Personal Desktop Support Technician and Coach for individuals and small businesses.  At almost every job I have ever held, I have been tasked with the role of IT guy, having the skills and experience. </li>
				<li> In content creation: The last 3 decades my creative works have included a large body of landscape and experimental photography, development in several software and website projects, blog and ebook publishing, and musical recordings. </li>  
				<li> Currently: While I have worked in IT and Development extensively through the last 20 years, for the last 10 I focused on creative endeavors involving writing.  I gave myself permission to explore the life of a writer for 10 years and now that 10 years has passed. Professionally in that time, most of my duties involved hardware and system consulting, and troubleshooting code, and training in the use of modern technology. Writing for me has become a skill and is no longer a passion.  I am currently engaged in rebuilding my career as an IT professional, consultant and trainer, as well as getting back into coding.</li>
